                <h3> About Pete </h3>
                <p> After being one of the many casualites of mass layoffs due to Covid-19 in 2020, I took this to reflect and focus on what I wanted to be doing the rest of my career. With a pasison for all things tech, an intrigue for development and after
                    many days and nights of research, I had made a decision.</p>

                <p>I enrolled in Thinkfuls Full-Stack Engineering Boot Camp and with it my journey to becoming a Web Developer has begun.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in hiring a new developer, or would like to colloborate on any projects, please feel free to reach out. I am very excited to be on this path.
